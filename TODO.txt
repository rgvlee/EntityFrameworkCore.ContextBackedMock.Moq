# TODO

- Add the rest of the DbContext and DbSet interface to mock set ups (async etc)
- Mock the DbContext DbSet properties (e.g., TestContext.TestEntities.Select(x => ...), if possible to do in a generic manner)
- Automatically mock all DbSet properties (again if possible, may be difficult given Set<T> is strongly typed and there is no Set(Type) method
- Update existing tests in line with best practice (method names, scope etc)
- Add tests for untested functionality
